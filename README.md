This project involves the visualization of diabetes patient data using Tableau. The goal is to provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of diabetic and non-diabetic patients through various graphical representations.

Visualizations:-
1) Distribution of Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Patients:
  - Used different shapes to represent diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
2) Blood Pressure Categories:
  - Summarized patients by blood pressure category using distinct shapes to differentiate between categories.
3) BMI by Age Groups:
  - Created a histogram to show the distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) across different age groups.
4) BMI Type Distribution:
  - A single bar chart representing the percent distribution of patients by BMI type.
5) Patient Breakdown by Blood Pressure and Diabetes:
  - Utilized a bar chart to show the breakdown of patients by blood pressure category and diabetes status.
6) Health Factors by Age Group:
  - Built a heat map to display various health factors categorized by age group.

Dashboard and Story Points:-
  - Combined all the visualizations into a cohesive dashboard.
  - Added story points to the dashboard to provide a narrative flow and context to the visualizations.
